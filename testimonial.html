                        make her prepare the daily notes after each session. She had
                        benefited greatly from the sessions.

                            into her dream university. We feel very blessed to have you as her

He always made himself available and taught me and retaught me everything as I needed. He was always running to do good things for the people in his community as well, and is truly a gift to the world. It is only because of him that I got an A- in the course and have used it to apply to nursing schools in Canada and the United States. I am full of appreciation for him, and am hopeful that he will be around to teach me when I need it next! </p>

                        Thank you for your endless support and effort!
                        My son improved his understanding and grade in Chemistry a great deal within such a short time.
                        I remember there was a clear improvement within just 1 month.
                        I only wish my son could have started working with you before he even started IB DP.
                        IB Chemistry is a tough course to deal with, especially combining it with other science courses. 
                        Therefore, your guidance for how to manage the time and pressure were crucial. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-0">My son was struggling with science courses and he was stressed when he started the regular online Chemistry lessons for support. 
                            The Previous 2 years of virtual education was taking its toll. My son lacked a solid foundation in Chemistry.
                            Your lessons gave him a huge boost on understanding the building blocks of the course and more.
                            My son changed his attitude towards Chemistry completely. 
                            I also would like to mention your positive attitude towards learning and student centered lessons made him feel safe to ask lots of questions and grow.
                            You became his life coach, Mr. Anshuman.

                    <p class="mb-1">Mr Anshuman Debnath has been teaching my son IB Chemistry SL since June 2021. He has been an exceptional tutor. Going far beyond the routine relationship that most tutors take, he takes a deep personal interest in the student and his/her progress. He is on top of every chapter and every concept within that and its relevance to both in-depth understanding and exams. After each lesson, he painstakingly follows up with detailed notes and exercises and ensures that the student completes them in time, reinforcing the lesson. It also helps him improve his retention; We are based in Frankfurt, Germany and my son studies in one of the founding IB schools. The time zone differences have not come in the way, and Anshuman goes to extra lengths to ensure that teaching schedules work to students' availability and advantage. He maintains constant touch with us and keeps us abreast of developments. This serves as a leading indicator to us and plugs any potential gaps. IBDP is very different to all the other boards and needs a different approach. Anshuman understands this well and works with the student. As the study progresses, he ensures that concepts touched on early in the year are revised well. From time to time, Anshuman coordinates with the student on his school exams and goes through the exam results to identify weak spots and address them effectively. Overall it has been a great experience with him, and I highly recommend him.</p>

I took tuition for two months right before the boards and scored an A*. He is very helpful and willingly caters to the student's preferred method of teaching. He checks up on his old students' progress and never shies away from clearing any doubts. He is definitely an invaluable asset and I would wholeheartedly recommend him as a teacher to any student who is struggling with the subject.</p>
